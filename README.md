# Endless-Flight
A unity game, for .Net Framework and C# course.

The project we are developing is a endless runner style game.
We are devloping this project in the Unity game engine which uses the .Net framework and we will programming the scripts in C#.
The vision for the game is a 3D endless runner game similiar to many games on the market such as subway surfers, temple run.
How ever our style will be quite different. The game will revolve around the player controlling a plane and flying endlessly to achieve a high score.
The player will have control over the plane , horizontally, and maybe vertically. 
The plane will fly over beautiful landscapes and the landscapes will change during the game.
There will be  objects in the planes path that it has to avoid, being the challenging part of the gameplay.
Many features are under consideration at the moment (Such as Facebook Integration, different gameplay features).
How ever the basic features outlined above are the main focus  and prioroties of the project.
