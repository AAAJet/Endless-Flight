The technology for this product in use will be :

Unity 3D game engine :
- This engine is perfect for our game as it runs on the .net framework and also incorporates the C# language.
- The game engine has alot of features built in that will help us realise our idea (game).
- This includes 3D object creation, terrain creation, visual effects, built  in animators etc.
- Most of these can be manipulated with drag and drop interaction.
- All of these objects can be controlled (programmed) using the C# Language in the forms of scripts that can be attached to the objects as a "component"
- All of the game Logic that will be implemented will be in the form of C# scripts aswell. Such as game objectives, game states etc.
- One of the best things about Unity is its cross platform support which is a crucial reason why we are also using it as our vision includes having this game work on both Android and IOS
